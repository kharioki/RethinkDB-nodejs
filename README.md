# RethinkDB-nodejs

RethinkDB is a document-oriented database that supports realtime queries.

> It is the first open-source, scalable JSON database built from the ground up for the realtime web. It inverts the traditional database architecture by exposing an exciting new acccess model: instead of polling for changes, the developer can tell RethinkDB to continously push updated query results to application in realtime.

RethinkDB is designed to be a fundamental part of your application, and is built to be extremely extensible.
